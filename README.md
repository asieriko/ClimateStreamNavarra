## Abstract
Climate change has an effect on the environmental conditions of different regions. Being able to track these changes is a powerful tool for adapting to evolving conditions. Weather data is continuously generated across multiple stations around the world, providing valuable information on climate patterns. 
Studying this data stream enables us to better understand the new climate patterns. This paper explores, through a stream  clustering algorithm, the potential of employing weather data to track the change in climate patterns in the Spanish region of Navarre over the last 20 years.
